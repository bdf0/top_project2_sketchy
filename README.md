Practice project 2 for The Odin Project - HTML/CSS/JS/jQuery based sketch toy

I've been using The Odin Project (http://www.theodinproject.com) to teach myself basic web development skills. This is my rendition of a jQuery based "etch-a-sketch," which is the second project in their series on front-end development (http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/javascript-and-jquery). Mouse over the colored square to trace a path.

I've chosen to make the follwing extensions to the original specification:

* Added a color picker to change background and "ink" colors.
